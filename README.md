First of all make it executable by typing: 
```
$ chmod +x createProject.sh
```
Then you can run it by typing the following:
```bash
$ ./createProject.sh ProjectName PythonVersion
```
Here's an example of making a project called neuralNet with python version 3.7
```bash
$ ./createProject.sh nerualNet 3.7
```
